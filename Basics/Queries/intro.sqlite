/* In this lesson, we will learn querying a database with one table named movies */

/* Take a look at the name and imdb rating of every movie in the database */

SELECT name, imdb_rating FROM movies;

/* Select all the distinct values in a column */

SELECT DISTINCT genre FROM movies;

/* Filter the results of a query using a WHERE clause */

SELECT * FROM movies WHERE imdb_rating > 8;

/* Filter the results by searching for a specific pattern in a column */

SELECT * FROM movies WHERE name LIKE 'Se_en';

/* % is a wildcard character that can be used with like */

SELECT * FROM movies WHERE name LIKE 'a%';

/*  a% - matches all the strings that begin with a 
    %a - matches all the strings that end with a */
    
/* BETWEEN is another special character that can be used in a where clause */

SELECT * FROM movies WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000;

/* Return all the comedy movies between 1990 and 2000 */

SELECT * FROM movies WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2000 AND genre = 'comedy';

/* OR operator */

SELECT * FROM movies WHERE genre = 'comedy' OR year < 1980;

/* List the data in a particular order */

SELECT * FROM movies ORDER BY imdb_ratings DESC;

/* Limit the result to 3 lowest rated movies */

SELECT * FROM movies ORDER BY imdb_rating ASC LIMIT 3;
